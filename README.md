# React native decentralized application
This is an example project of how you build a dapp using react native, expo-cli and moralisSDK. This app will communicate with a smart contract on the ethereum test network.

## Requirements
Install expo-cli globally so you can test your application on different devices (web, androi and ios).
```
npm install --global expo-cli
```

## Start application
To start the application you can just run:
```
npm start
```

## Use Brave browser with development environment
Go to Brave settings and select wallet on the left side. There you can set the wallet provider you want to use as your default one (e.g. brave, metamask, phantom, etc.).
